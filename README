## A simple command line todo program

This simple program was the first python program I ever wrote that wasn't a book/course exercise. At that time, I was using a simple text file to manage all of my todos, and I wanted something slightly fancier but didn't require me to login or have a bunch of bloat. I lost interest in making this halfway because I found an Android app that did exactly what I needed, so I abandoned this project while it was still unfinished.

## How to run it

Download the files into a new directory and run "python run.py". You should be greeted with some options.

## Structure

The todolist.py and todo.py files contain the model for the todo, and the *functions.py contain the functions used to manipulate those classes. "todo_functions.py" handles all the model manipulation, and "io_functions.py" handles saving and loading files.
